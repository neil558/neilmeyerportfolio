1) THE IMAGES

This template comes with a selection of open-source social-media icons. Only the folder called 01-flat social media icons
have icons that are auctually used in the template. The others are just there to add a little bit of value to the template.
If you are happy with the social-media icons as used in the theme be sure to delete the other 5 folders before you upload 
to a web-server. These icons can be found in the img/icons folder. All the relevant license information about these icons 
can be found in these folders.

The logo is from a website called Logodust - https://logodust.com/
